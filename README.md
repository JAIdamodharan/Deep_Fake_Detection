# Deep_Fake_Detection
Deepfakes pose serious cybersecurity risks via impersonation and executive fraud. This project builds an AI detection system for video and audio deepfakes using CNNs, Vision Transformers, and transformer-based audio models, with ResNeXt+LSTM for temporal analysis, achieving 93% accuracy on benchmarks.
